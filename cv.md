### Briefly About Myself:
  I graduated from the State Medical Academy in 2013 and worked as a nephrologist for 8 years. Since 2017, I have also worked as the deputy chief physician in a large private clinic with a staff of 50 people under my leadership. We have made significant progress in both medical and organizational aspects of our work. It hasn't been easy, and I am proud of our achievements. Currently, I am on maternity leave as my daughter is already 2 years old. Over the past year, my family and I have been living in Kazakhstan, and we are looking for an opportunity to move to Europe. I have always been attracted to the IT sphere, and during my "vacation," I had the chance to explore it further through The Odin Project course. I absolutely love this magical world and I want to dive deeper.
